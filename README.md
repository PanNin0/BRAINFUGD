# BRAINFUGD v1.0
This is a interpreter for Brainfugd that runs entirely in Python

Brief Explanation

This is BRAINFUGD, a programming language in python based off the original programming BRAINFUCK. The difference between this and that is that this is entirely run and coded in through your python terminal and unlike brainfuck this comes with a few handy dandy extra commands that should make your time using this a little easier (Brainfuck originally had 8, this one has 19). If you make anything cool using this please send me an email of what you've made at BreadBoy399@gmail.com 

Thank you for downloading my program!
